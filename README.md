# Ant-Colony-Optimisation-ACO-Coursework-
A university assignment using ant colony optimisation to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem

This work was completed a long time ago when I was very inexperienced in python and so the code is poorly written, overly verbose, inefficient etc. Feel free to email me at lewis.e.hall1@gmail.com for any questions you have on it.

The pdf titled ACO_report.pdf is the report I wrote on the work and the problem it solved.
